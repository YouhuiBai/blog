## About Me
I am a Principal engineer of [HUAWEI company](https://www.huawei.com/) at Theory Lab of 2012 Labs, and working on the research of large scale DNN training and inference systems.

Before joining the HUAWEI, I received my PhD degree in computer science from [Advanced Data Systems Lab (ADSL)](http://adsl.ustc.edu.cn/), [University of Science and Technology of China (USTC)](https://www.ustc.edu.cn/) under the supervision of [Yinlong Xu](http://cs.ustc.edu.cn/2020/0828/c23235a460084/page.htm) and [Cheng Li](http://staff.ustc.edu.cn/~chengli7/index.html). During my PhD study, I work closely with [Cheng Li](http://staff.ustc.edu.cn/~chengli7/index.html), [Feng Yan](https://www.cse.unr.edu/~fyan/index.html) and [Ruichuan Chen](https://www.ruichuan.org/). I obtained my B.S degree at USTC too.

My research interests lie in various topics related to computer systems such as distributed ML systems, LLM algorithm and system co-design technology, large scale graph processing systems and etc, particularly in improving performance and easy-of-use of the above mentioned systems.
