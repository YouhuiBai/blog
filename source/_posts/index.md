## About Me
I am a senior engineer of [HUAWEI company](https://www.huawei.com/) at 2012 Laboratories-Central Software Institute-Distributed and Parallel Software Laboratory-Parallel Distributed Computing Laboratory, and working on [MindSpore](https://gitee.com/mindspore/mindspore) project to make the distributed training strategies more advanced.

Before joining the HUAWEI, I received my PhD degree in computer science from [Advanced Data Systems Lab (ADSL)](http://adsl.ustc.edu.cn/), [University of Science and Technology of China (USTC)](https://www.ustc.edu.cn/) under the supervision of [Yinlong Xu](http://cs.ustc.edu.cn/2020/0828/c23235a460084/page.htm) and [Cheng Li](http://staff.ustc.edu.cn/~chengli7/index.html). During my PhD study, I work closely with [Cheng Li](http://staff.ustc.edu.cn/~chengli7/index.html), [Feng Yan](https://www.cse.unr.edu/~fyan/index.html) and [Ruichuan Chen](https://www.ruichuan.org/). I obtained my B.S degree at USTC too.

My research interests lie in various topics related to computer systems such as distributed ML systems, large scale graph processing systems and etc, particularly in improving performance and easy-of-use of the above mentioned systems.
